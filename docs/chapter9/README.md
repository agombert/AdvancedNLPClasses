## 🚀 Session 9: Large Language Models (LLMs) Basics

In this ninth session, we dive into the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — from the foundations of ChatGPT to advanced prompt engineering and innovative training techniques like LoRA and QLoRA.

We explore the **training processes** (SFT, RM, PPO), how models like **GitHub Copilot and Cursor** boost productivity, and advanced topics like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Understand the key components of **LLM training**: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reward Modeling (RM), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
2. Learn about **prompt engineering, few-shot learning**, and structured output generation.
3. Analyze the **advantages and challenges** of RAG and why hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE) can overcome limitations.
4. Grasp how **fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)** enables adapting large models on a single GPU.
5. Connect LLM-powered tools like **Cursor, LlamaIndex**, and **Vera** to real-world applications.
