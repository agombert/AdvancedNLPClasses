# LLM Introduction

## Session 9: Large Language Models

This session introduces the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring their capabilities, limitations, and practical applications through prompt engineering and fine-tuning.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the architecture and capabilities of modern Large Language Models

- Chain of thought prompting for complex reasoning tasks
- Formatting outputs for structured information extraction
- Prompt design principles and best practices
- Instruction tuning and alignment techniques
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, P-tuning, etc.)
- Full fine-tuning vs. adapter-based approaches

#### Advanced LLM Concepts

- Scaling laws and emergent abilities in LLMs
- Model architectures: decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder
- Open vs. closed models: comparing capabilities and limitations
- Multilingual capabilities and cross-lingual transfer
- Multimodal extensions to language models
- Retrieval-augmented generation
