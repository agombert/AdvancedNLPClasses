The asteroid, designated 2004 BL86, will safely pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon on January 26. It will be the closest by any known space rock this large until asteroid 1999 AN10 flies past Earth in 2027. See the Asteroid's route below . At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. Due to its orbit around the sun, the asteroid is currently only visible by astronomers with large telescopes who are located in the southern hemisphere. But by Jan. 26, the space rock's changing position will make it visible to those in the northern hemisphere. From its reflected brightness, astronomers estimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile (0.5 kilometers) in size. At the time of its closest approach on January 26, the asteroid will be approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. 'Monday, January 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to Earth for at least the next 200 years,' said Don Yeomans, who is retiring as manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, after 16 years in the position. 'And while it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' One way NASA scientists plan to learn more about 2004 BL86 is to observe it with microwaves. NASA's Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to Earth. 'When we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer Lance Benner of JPL, the principal investigator for the Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'At present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' Don't Panic! Nasa says 'While it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' Asteroid 2004 BL86 was initially discovered on Jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey in White Sands, New Mexico. The asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said Yeomans. 'Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'                                                                      2004 BL86 will pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon .\\nEstimate that the asteroid is about a third of a mile (0.5 kilometers) in size .\\nNasa says it poses no threat to Earth 'for the foreseeable future'\n",

Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond apologizes after a U.S. soldier admitted using the Quran for target practice. The Iraqi Islamic Party, the movement of Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, condemned what it said was a \"blatant assault on the sanctities of Muslims all over the world.\" An American staff sergeant who was a sniper section leader used a Quran for target practice on May 9. The U.S. commander in Baghdad on Saturday issued a formal apology and read a letter of apology from the shooter. The sergeant has been relieved of duty as a section leader \"with prejudice,\" officially reprimanded by his commanding general, dismissed from his regiment and redeployed -- reassigned to the United States. But the Iraqi Islamic Party -- which said it reacted to the news \"with deep resentment and indignation\" -- wants the \"severest of punishments\" for the action. \"What truly concerns us is the repetition of these crimes that have happened in the past when mosques were destroyed and pages of the Holy Quran were torn and used for disgraceful acts by U.S. soldiers,\" al-Hashimi said. \"I have asked that first this apology be officially documented; second a guarantee from the U.S. military to inflict the maximum possible punishment on this soldier so it would be a deterrent for the rest of the soldiers in the future.\" A tribal leader said \"the criminal act by U.S. forces\" took place at a shooting range at the Radhwaniya police station on Baghdad's western outskirts. After the shooters left, an Iraqi policeman found a target marked in the middle of the bullet-riddled Quran.  Read how the soldier could have provoked a crisis . Copies of the pictures of the Quran obtained by CNN show multiple bullet holes and an expletive scrawled on one of its pages. On Saturday, Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond, commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, appeared at an apology ceremony flanked by leaders from Radhwaniya.  Watch as the U.S. formally apologizes ¬ª . \"I come before you here seeking your forgiveness,\" Hammond said to tribal leaders and others gathered. \"In the most humble manner, I look in your eyes today, and I say please forgive me and my soldiers.\" Another military official kissed a Quran and presented it as \"a humble gift\" to the tribal leaders. Hammond also read from the shooter's letter: \"I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together. ... My actions were shortsighted, very reckless and irresponsible, but in my heart [the actions] were not malicious.\" Hammond said, \"The actions of one soldier were nothing more than criminal behavior. I've come to this land to protect you, to support you -- not to harm you -- and the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable.\" The soldier reportedly claimed he wasn't aware the book was the Quran, but U.S. officials rejected his assertion.

David Kent . Andy Carroll has taken an understandably glum-looking selfie in hospital. The striker took to Instagram to post a snap of himself just as he prepared to go in for ankle surgery. And you can understand the look on his face, after several injury-ravaged seasons with Liverpool and West Ham, Carroll was finally hoping for a clean bill of health as he finally looked to fulfill the promise he showed following his breakthrough at Newcastle.VIDEO Scroll down to see behind the scenes of West Ham's new kit unveiling .

But, once again, it wasn't to be, as an ankle injury on a tour of New Zealand ruled him out for up to four months. It is then expected that he will not . return to action until December at the earliest, missing the crucial . start of West Ham's campaign. The . England international was unable to play last season until January after . injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances. That . injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the . new campaign by heading out to New Zealand for the club's pre-season . tour when this fresh injury struck in training. It is understood to be . completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago. In . the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar . fascia ‚Äì the tendons that run through the arch of the foot, connecting . the heel to the toes ‚Äì in his right foot leaping for a ball against .

      "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles has long been a destination for artistic dreamers from Europe: Zsa Zsa Gabor moved to Hollywood from Hungary in the 1940s to act. Warsaw-born Roman Polanski moved to Southern California in the 1960s to direct. Not to mention one ambitious actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger, who arguably has done more to boost California's image as a place receptive to Europeans than any tourism initiative the state might have dreamed up the past 30 years. But for accented aspiring pop stars from the EU and beyond, L.A. hasn't generally been considered the place to launch an international music career. That honor fell to cities such as London and New York. Until now. These days Manhattan is getting the flyover treatment as singers from all over Europe and farther east set their sights on the U.S. market via Hollywood as the new must-conquer gateway to American ears and eyes. Artists such as Estonia's Kerli, Italy's Marco Bosco, t.A.T.u.'s Lena Katina from Russia, Slovakia's TWiiNS and Austria's Fawni are suddenly swarming L.A. with dreams of making it big. Their presence is being felt at small clubs such as the Troubadour (Katina played a solo show at the venue last year) to red carpets (Fawni is now well known to Hollywood event photographers) to purchased billboards on Sunset Boulevard (Bosco recently bought expensive outdoor media to promote himself along the busy, high visibility corridor). \"I love being here...Los Angeles is my second home now,\" says Katina, who is working on her first solo record and now splits her time between L.A. and Moscow. Katina and other singers from Russia and Europe's timing couldn't be better: America has finally started to embrace the increasing globalization of pop music on a scale beyond the occasional super group (see ABBA) or German one-hit wonder (see Nena's \"99 Luftballoons\") thanks largely to Websites such as YouTube, which has leveled the playing field and cut out past gatekeepers such as MTV. Swedish singer Robyn topped many critical lists in 2010, with Denmark's Medina set to make similar inroads in the United States this year with early adopters in the pop and dance music arenas. But perhaps the most interesting singer ready to make the crossover in 2011 is Estonia's Kerli. \"When I first got here, someone told me 'there are no friends in the music business' and I was so hurt,\" the former winner of a Baltic version of \"American Idol\" said over coffee at a West Hollywood restaurant last month. \"But Los Angeles is an amazing place to live once you find the people that inspire you, and I've found that circle of friends here,\" the singer said. \"We make art together, and we constantly feed off each other.\" The blonde beauty who looks like a glammed-out Goth version of Lady Gaga (though she and her fans loathe the comparison) and sounds like a hybrid of Bjork, Brandy and Avril Lavigne moved to L.A. around four years ago and has been slowly winning over American fans ever since. Her debut for Island Records, 2008's \"Love Is Dead,\" did fairly well for a new artist, considering Kerli is pushing a sound she herself calls \"Bubblegoth.\" According to Nielsen SoundScan, around 65,000 copies were sold. However, both the singer and her label are thinking bigger this year after buzz surrounding her just-released \"Army Of Love\" began heating up the internet. It's too soon to tell if mainstream pop radio stations will embrace Kerli in 2011 (her follow-up full length record is expected to see a release by summer), but there are encouraging signs. AOL's popular Popeater blog featured the singer late last year in a campaign worthy of a former \"American Idol\" star; rolling out her video for the released-in-December \"Army Of Love\" with video diaries building up to a December 22 premiere. \"It's like Euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,\" Kerli said of \"Army Of Love,\" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in Estonia). Adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the Baltic states and other European countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as Kerli on the U.S. pop charts. And while European artists who have \"made it\" overseas have been buying second homes in the Hollywood Hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as Slovakia's TWiiNS, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in America after a modicum of success elsewhere. The duo, who are identical twins, moved to L.A. last year. They are currently working on their first record for L.A.-based indie label B Records with known U.S. producers including Bryan Todd, who has worked with names such as Jordin Sparks. \"We love Los Angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,\" Veronika N√≠zlov√© said via email last month. Her twin sister Daniela added the transition has not been easy. \"It's really hard to come from Eastern Europe and try to achieve success in America. We are not native speakers, we are not Americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. \" TWiiNS, which scored a minor European hit last year with a remake of Sabrina Salerno's 1980s hit \"Boys,\" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. In their forthcoming single \"Welcome to Hollywood,\" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the City of Angels. \"The song is not about the perfect Hollywood,\" Veronika said, \"It's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. You should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. Hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it.\" Sage advice from Los Angeles' latest √©migr√©s, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: \"Welcome to Hollywood/Boy you better give it up before it gets you down/Welcome to Hollywood/Just got to get a grip of how to get around.\"                                                      Pop stars from all over Europe are setting their sights on the U.S. market .\\nEstonia's Kerli, Italy's Marco Bosco and Austria's Fawni want to make it big in L.A.\\nLos Angeles has long been a destination for European artists seeking fame .\n",

As the dramatic spectacle of the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London unfolded Friday night, organizers estimated a billion people around the world would be glued to their television sets to see it, either live or delayed by a few hours. Tens of thousands more were lucky enough to have a seat inside the Olympic Stadium, the centerpiece of Olympic Park in east London. Dubbed \"Isles of Wonder,\" it was quite a show -- fast-paced and diverse, with everything from people dancing in period costumes to a pseudo house party. It featured tributes to the British countryside and the Industrial Revolution (complete with smokestacks emerging from the ground), showcased the \"Chariots of Fire\" soundtrack as well as pop music staples from the Beatles to Amy Winehouse, and even comedy bits featuring Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson), actor Daniel Craig and even Queen Elizabeth II herself. The queen was among the more than 80 heads of state attending the event, which sets the scene for the Games to come. London cheers Olympic torch as opening day nears . The organizers of the London Games were well aware they had a tough act to follow after the Beijing extravaganza four years ago, which featured thousands of drummers, acrobats, martial artists and dancers performing under a light display at the soaring \"Bird's Nest\" Stadium. Some details of the √Ç¬£27 million show were released in advance, but many more remained closely guarded secrets. A Twitter hashtag, #savethesurprise, started by Olympic organizers to appeal to those in the know not to spoil the show for others, had been embraced by many, although not all. The 10 coolest tech stories of the 2012 London Olympics . Giant screens also displayed the message within the stadium during the two rehearsals. Those who opted not to play along incurred the social-media wrath of many who did want to \"save the surprise.\" The show, masterminded by artistic director Danny Boyle, best known for the Oscar-winning film \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" drew part of its inspiration from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest.\" It began at 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) with the tolling of the largest harmonically tuned bell in Europe, cast by the nearby Whitechapel Foundry, which also produced Big Ben and the Liberty Bell. The sound echoed the peals of bells that rang out across the country for three minutes Friday morning, Big Ben among them, to set the nation's Olympic spirit racing. The show's opening scene -- dubbed \"Green and Pleasant,\" after a line from a poem by William Blake -- then unfurled, presenting an idyllic view of the British countryside. The elaborate set comprised rolling hills, fields and rivers, complete with picnicking families, sport being played on a village green and real farmyard animals: ducks, geese, 12 horses, three cows and 70 sheep, plus three sheepdogs to keep them in line. Chasing the gold-dust of 'Brand Olympics' The flower of each of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom also were represented -- the rose of England, the Scottish thistle, Welsh daffodil and flax from Northern Ireland. Boyle also lined up fake clouds to shade his pastoral scene. Other set pieces paid tribute to Britain's National Health Service, children's literature (showcasing characters from the evil Lord Voldemort of Harry Pottery infamy to magical nanny Mary Poppins) and popular music. It was all a mammoth production involving not just Boyle and his technical crew, but also a cast of 10,000 adult volunteers and 900 local schoolchildren. Then there was a heavy-duty flying system, nearly 13,000 props and an array of technological wizardry. After these performances, the athletes -- who, after all, are the real stars of the Olympic show -- entered the stadium, team by team in alphabetical order, apart from Greece, which enters first in recognition of its status as the birthplace of the Games, and Great Britain, entering last, the position reserved for the host nation. Why gritty East End is London's gold standard . After speeches from Olympic officials -- including Sebastian Coe, head of the London organizing committee and himself a former gold medalist -- the queen officially declared the Games open and the Olympic flag was later hoisted above the stadium, where it will fly throughout the competition. The grand finale saw five-time gold medalist rower Steve Redgrave carry the torch into the stadium, where he handed the flame off to seven promising young athletes. They then lit parts of the large cauldron, triggering a chain of events that culminated in small flames converging in the sky above the stadium. This capped the torch's 70-day, 8,000-mile relay around the United Kingdom -- weeks that had been marked with anticipation. Is the Olympics worth more than Google?

    "\n",
    "‚úÖ We analyzed the distribution of **article lengths** in the CNN/DailyMail dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average length**: ~690 words,  \n",
    "- **Range**: 8 to 2300+ words,  \n",
    "- **Most articles**: ~500‚Äì800 words (peak of distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Why This Matters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking is crucial in **RAG** pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we index articles **as-is**, long articles may **exceed LLM context limits** or have too much noise.\n",
    "- **Splitting into smaller chunks** (e.g., 200‚Äì300 words) improves retrieval granularity and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- To **reduce compute needs** (especially for **embedding generation**), we‚Äôll **randomly sample 5000 articles** for this demo.  \n",
    "- These samples will be **chunked** and embedded with **sentence-transformers** to build our retrieval index.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs start by **sampling the data** and preparing chunks for the RAG pipeline!"

Public wasn't difficult for him. \"I made up my mind that I was never going to let my public title become my personal identity,\" he says. He embraced what he calls a sense of normalcy after he left office, going to movies and basketball games. A year or two after he left office, Pataki went to Madison Square Garden with a group of friends to see the Knicks play. And he wanted to stand in line to get himself a hot dog -- something elected officials tend not to do. \"I loved it,\" he says. Even though fellow fans recognized him and offered to let him jump the queue, Pataki waited in line for his hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. \"I felt really good about the fact that it was just comfortable for me to be on line with the rest,\" he says. Pataki decided in the middle of his third term in office that he would\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚úèÔ∏è Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **LLM-Only Answers**  \n",
    "- Answers are **well-structured** and provide general, textbook-like responses.  \n",
    "- They are **factually plausible** but not always tied directly to the specific article content.  \n",
    "- They sometimes **include extra details** (like testing, vaccination, travel restrictions) that were **not in the article** but are part of the LLM‚Äôs general knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **RAG-Generated Answers**  \n",
    "- Answers are **concise and closely aligned with the article‚Äôs actual text**.  \n",
    "- They **mirror the language** and points made in the retrieved chunks, making them more **context-specific**.  \n",
    "- They **avoid hallucination** (inventing new information) and stay grounded in what was **retrieved from Qdrant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üü¢ Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **LLM-only** approach tends to **generalize and expand** on the question using its broader training data.  \n",
    "- The **RAG approach** is more **precise** and **factual**‚Äîit directly reflects the **source material**.  \n",
    "- **RAG‚Äôs answers are shorter and sharper**, focusing on the evidence provided, while LLM-only answers are more discursive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RAG provides grounded, specific answers** ‚Äì it‚Äôs great for factual QA when exact information is critical (e.g., journalism, scientific retrieval).  \n",
    "- **LLM-only** is useful for **general knowledge** but can include **hallucinated or extraneous content**.  \n",
    "- In a real-world system, **verifiability matters**‚ÄîRAG helps to ensure that answers are backed by actual documents, which is critical for **trustworthiness**.\n",

    "## üîç Reranking in RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "While our retriever has done a great job pulling in relevant chunks of information from our corpus, as the question were pretty linked to a single articles we can imagine much more complex questions that necesitate documents from several sources. The next step is to enhance the quality of these retrieved results through **reranking**. Reranking is especially useful because:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ It helps us identify the *most relevant* chunks from the top retrieved ones, rather than relying solely on initial similarity scores. \n",
    "‚úÖ It improves the final context passed to the language model for answer generation, leading to more precise and comprehensive responses. \n",
    "‚úÖ It mitigates issues like partial matches or overly generic chunks dominating the retrieval phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need reranking?**  \n",
    "Although vector similarity (like cosine distance) helps to narrow down chunks related to a query, these initial scores don't always reflect *true relevance* or semantic richness of the content for the given question. Reranking helps reorder the top-k chunks based on a more nuanced evaluation of their relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some common reranking techniques:**  \n",
    "- **Cross-Encoder Models (like BERT-based re-rankers):** Take a query and a candidate chunk and return a fine-grained relevance score by jointly processing them.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid Scoring (like dense+BM25 fusion):** Combine dense embeddings with traditional keyword-based scores to balance precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT**: reranking using the `colbert-ir/colbertv2.0` model. ColBERT computes late interaction scores by computing similarity matrix between all query and document token embeddings, then taking max similarity for each query token and summing across all query tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Qdrant fits in:**  \n",
    "Qdrant allows seamless integration with reranking steps because it provides efficient retrieval of top-k candidates. Once we have those, we can plug them into a reranker (like a cross-encoder or a separate re-ranking model) to get improved ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ Next, we'll explore implementing a reranking step with our Qdrant retriever and see how our retriever's performance changes with this additional layer of semantic evaluation!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a couple of more complex questions to see the differences. "
