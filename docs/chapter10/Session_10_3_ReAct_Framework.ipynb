    "\n",
    "**ReAct** stands for:\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: The LLM thinks step by step to break down complex questions.\n",
    "- **Acting**: The LLM decides when to **call external tools** (like search or Wikipedia) to gather missing data.\n",
    "- **Observing**: It integrates the **observed tool output** back into its chain-of-thought ‚Äî **dynamic & adaptive**!\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework was proposed in [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) to help LLMs handle **complex, real-world tasks** that require **dynamic knowledge** and **external verification**.\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)‚ÄîAI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore a **fully automated ReAct framework** implementation that uses **structured JSON-based reasoning** to answer complex questions. Let‚Äôs break down the main ideas and components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initialize** the conversation:  \n",
    "   - A system prompt (`REACT_PROMPT_NEWS`) defines the ReAct process and rules.\n",
    "   - The user‚Äôs question starts the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ **Iterative Reasoning**:  \n",
    "   - The LLM‚Äôs JSON response is parsed and checked for errors.\n",
    "   - If an **action** is proposed, the framework **calls the relevant tool** and logs the result.\n",
    "   - If an **answer** is given, the framework stops and returns the final response.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, the conversation continues until either a final answer is found or the **max number of iterations** is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ **Tool Execution**:  \n",
    "   - `execute_search_tool` and `execute_lookup_tool` call the external tools and **format** results for clarity.\n",
    "   - Results (observations) are fed back to the LLM for further reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ **Iteration Logging**:  \n",
    "   - Each cycle‚Äôs reasoning step, actions, and results are **logged** for transparency and later review.\n",
    "\n",
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Answer**:  \n",
    "   - Once an answer is found, the entire **reasoning chain** and the final response are presented in a structured format.\n"

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)‚ÄîAI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.\n",

    "## üéØ **Conclusion and Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Summary of the Final Output**  \n",
    "Our **JSON-based ReAct framework** successfully handled a complex multi-part question about **AI today** and **latest climate change headlines in France, Spain, and Germany**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent **looked up** what is considered **AI today**, using **Wikipedia** as context.  \n",
    "- It **iteratively searched** for the **latest news on climate change** across three countries.  \n",
    "- It **detected gaps** (no results for Spain and only partial coverage for France) and provided **transparent explanations**.  \n",
    "- Finally, it **synthesized a coherent and accurate answer** combining all these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üü© **Key Strengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Clear **thought and action steps** at each iteration.  \n",
    "‚úÖ Effective **tool usage** (Wikipedia for AI context, DuckDuckGo for real-time headlines).  \n",
    "‚úÖ Final answer is **structured and grounded** in the information retrieved by the tools.  \n",
    "‚úÖ The framework **acknowledged data limitations** (no results for Spain), showing responsible handling of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "üîé **1Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance Retrieval Strategy**  \n",
    "- Incorporate **query expansion** techniques to handle missing data better.  \n",
    "- Use **multi-vector retrieval** to capture more nuanced and comprehensive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß™ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Validate with Human Judgement**  \n",
    "- Cross-check the final answer‚Äôs relevance and accuracy with **human feedback** for sensitive use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìà **3Ô∏è‚É£ Fine-Tune ReAct Prompt**  \n",
    "- Adjust prompt examples and expectations to further reduce hallucination or biases in tool selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "üåç **4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply to New Domains**  \n",
    "- Extend this ReAct framework to other areas like **public policy**, **scientific research**, or **market trends** ‚Äî wherever **structured reasoning** and **external tool use** are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü•≥ **Final Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise **showcases the power of combining LLM reasoning** with real-time tools in a **ReAct framework**. It‚Äôs a **powerful, modular approach** that can handle complex, evolving queries by **bridging static knowledge** with **dynamic, up-to-date information**.
