    "# 🔍 ReAct Framework: LLMs Reason and Act with External Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** stands for:\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: The LLM thinks step by step to break down complex questions.\n",
    "- **Acting**: The LLM decides when to **call external tools** (like search or Wikipedia) to gather missing data.\n",
    "- **Observing**: It integrates the **observed tool output** back into its chain-of-thought — **dynamic & adaptive**!\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework was proposed in [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) to help LLMs handle **complex, real-world tasks** that require **dynamic knowledge** and **external verification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Show how LLMs can **think out loud** (chain-of-thought) **and** dynamically decide to fetch missing information.  \n",
    "2️⃣ See how ReAct helps LLMs **refine answers iteratively** — no static prompt, no single-shot retrieval.  \n",
    "3️⃣ Illustrate the ReAct flow in a **practical use case**: getting **up-to-date news** and **background context** (e.g., on AI in France and Spain).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Tools for ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll combine:\n",
    "- **DuckDuckGo Search API** (`ddg_news_search`): For the latest news headlines.\n",
    "- **Wikipedia Summaries** (`get_wikipedia_summary`): For historical and conceptual background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Let’s See ReAct in Action!\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll define:\n",
    "- The **ReAct-style prompt**: guiding the LLM to **think, act, observe** iteratively.\n",
    "- Let it **run live** — and see the final answer it creates!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Note**: Unlike earlier sessions, here we focus **only on ReAct** — no baseline comparisons. Let’s see how well ReAct works **on its own**!"

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.\n"

    "## 📝 Automated ReAct Framework with JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore a **fully automated ReAct framework** implementation that uses **structured JSON-based reasoning** to answer complex questions. Let’s break down the main ideas and components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Initialize** the conversation:  \n",
    "   - A system prompt (`REACT_PROMPT_NEWS`) defines the ReAct process and rules.\n",
    "   - The user’s question starts the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **Iterative Reasoning**:  \n",
    "   - The LLM’s JSON response is parsed and checked for errors.\n",
    "   - If an **action** is proposed, the framework **calls the relevant tool** and logs the result.\n",
    "   - If an **answer** is given, the framework stops and returns the final response.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, the conversation continues until either a final answer is found or the **max number of iterations** is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **Tool Execution**:  \n",
    "   - `execute_search_tool` and `execute_lookup_tool` call the external tools and **format** results for clarity.\n",
    "   - Results (observations) are fed back to the LLM for further reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ **Iteration Logging**:  \n",
    "   - Each cycle’s reasoning step, actions, and results are **logged** for transparency and later review.\n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣ **Final Answer**:  \n",
    "   - Once an answer is found, the entire **reasoning chain** and the final response are presented in a structured format.\n"

      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.\n",

    "✅ Final answer is **structured and grounded** in the information retrieved by the tools.  \n",
    "✅ The framework **acknowledged data limitations** (no results for Spain), showing responsible handling of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔎 **1️⃣ Enhance Retrieval Strategy**  \n",
    "- Incorporate **query expansion** techniques to handle missing data better.  \n",
    "- Use **multi-vector retrieval** to capture more nuanced and comprehensive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 **2️⃣ Validate with Human Judgement**  \n",
    "- Cross-check the final answer’s relevance and accuracy with **human feedback** for sensitive use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 **3️⃣ Fine-Tune ReAct Prompt**  \n",
    "- Adjust prompt examples and expectations to further reduce hallucination or biases in tool selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌍 **4️⃣ Apply to New Domains**  \n",
    "- Extend this ReAct framework to other areas like **public policy**, **scientific research**, or **market trends** — wherever **structured reasoning** and **external tool use** are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥳 **Final Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise **showcases the power of combining LLM reasoning** with real-time tools in a **ReAct framework**.
