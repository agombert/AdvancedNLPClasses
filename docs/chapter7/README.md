# Injustice & Biases in NLP

## Session 7: Ethical Considerations in Language Models

This session addresses the critical issues of bias, fairness, and ethical considerations in NLP systems, with a focus on identifying and mitigating harmful biases in large language models.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the sources and types of biases in NLP systems
- Learn to identify biases in language models and their outputs
- Explore techniques for measuring and quantifying bias
- Develop strategies for mitigating biases in NLP applications
- Consider the broader ethical implications of deploying language technologies

### Topics Covered

#### Are Large Language Models Stochastic Parrots?

- Critical examination of large language models and their limitations
- Understanding how models reproduce biases present in training data
- The "stochastic parrot" critique and its implications
- Evaluating the utility of language models across different demographics and contexts
- Accessibility and inclusivity concerns in NLP technologies
- Environmental and computational costs of large language models

#### Detecting and Mitigating Biases

- Types of biases: gender, racial, cultural, socioeconomic, and others
- Methods for detecting bias in word embeddings and language models
- Quantitative metrics for measuring bias in NLP systems
- Bias mitigation strategies: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing
- Techniques for self-diagnosis and self-debiasing in language models
- Balancing bias mitigation with model performance
