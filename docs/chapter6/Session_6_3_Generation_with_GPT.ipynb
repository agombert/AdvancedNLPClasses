The film has a very genuine feel to it--an understated, quiet, deeply moving story of a family aching with grief. The dialogue is sparse but telling, and the nonverbal acting is outstanding. Sort of like a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics.<br /><br />The Stone Boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.\n",

        "            Review:\n",
        "            The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.\n",

        "            Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it\\'s intrigue, I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained \"your father died today\" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.<br /><br />This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.<br /><br />This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it\\'s over. I LOVED movies such as \"Trainspotting\" or \"Requiem for a Dream\" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn.\n",

        "            I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /><br />I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this...\n",

Moments that should evoke laughter or tears instead provoke discomfort through their mediocrity. The music, an uninspired collection of generic tunes, does nothing to elevate the scenes but instead serves as a reminder of how poorly the emotional beats are constructed.\n",

            "In what is intended to be a poignant exploration of redemption, this film ultimately falls flat, succumbing to clich√© after clich√©. The plot, which should resonate with emotional weight, instead feels more like a checklist of tropes featuring a tortured protagonist searching for forgiveness. The screenplay lacks depth, failing to develop supporting characters beyond their one-dimensional roles. Jonah Fisher's performance as the lead is unconvincing and wooden, making it difficult to root for his character, while Sienna Torres and Luke Chan are relegated to predictable archetypes that add little to the narrative.\n",

            "Visually, the cross-country journey should have provided a feast for the eyes. However, the direction lacks creativity, relying on dull cinematography and uninspired framing that strip the landscapes of any emotional resonance. The score, meant to enhance the drama, instead feels overly sentimental and manipulative, distracting rather than supporting the storytelling. What could have been a compelling meditation on loss and redemption turns into a tedious exercise in eye-rolling. In the end, this film is a disappointing misfire that fails to deliver on its promising premise, leaving viewers unsatisfied and yearning for something with genuine substance.\n",

            "In a genre already fraught with cliches, this film adds little to the post-apocalyptic narrative. The premise of a young woman harnessing the power of music to commune with spirits is promising, yet it quickly devolves into a scattered mess of half-baked ideas and implausible plot points.

While the premise involving a mysterious rainstorm sounds intriguing, it quickly dissolves into a series of clich√©d encounters and shallow character arcs that fail to engage the audience. The performances by Samuel Olmo and Priya Kapoor are painfully wooden, lacking the chemistry needed to breathe life into their roles.

            "In an era where originality is paramount, this film falls woefully flat, offering a convoluted plot that attempts to intertwine heist thrills with metaphysical musings but instead creates a jumbled mess. The premise of stealing dreams from a secret vault tantalizes at first, yet devolves into a series of predictable twists that lack any real impact. The characters, portrayed by a capable cast, are painfully one-dimensional, leaving the audience with little to invest in their fates.\n",

            "The direction is meandering, relying heavily on gimmicky special effects that fail to mask the film's narrative weaknesses. What should have been visually stunning sequences become disjointed and confusing, often instead evoking laughter where tension should thrive. The score, while attempting to create suspense, instead feels like a cheap knockoff of better soundtracks, failing to enhance the viewing experience.\n",

        "### üîç Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Boost (Up to \\~650 samples total):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Adding up to 400 synthetic samples (for a total of 650) significantly improved all metrics.\n",
        "   * At this point, the model reached an **F1 score of \\~0.92**, nearly matching our previous benchmark trained with **1,000 real samples**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Degradation Beyond 650 Samples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * As we pushed beyond 650 total samples, performance **plateaued or slightly declined**.\n",
        "   * This suggests that adding too many synthetic examples can **introduce noise**, reduce diversity, or cause the model to overfit on artificial patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Instability with Some Sizes (e.g., 350 samples):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * We observed **sharp performance drops** at certain points, particularly around 350 total samples.\n",
        "   * This shows that **not all synthetic examples are helpful** ‚Äî some may confuse the model or misalign with the task distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### üéì What This Tells Us\n",
        "\n",
        "* Synthetic reviews from LLMs can be **incredibly powerful for data augmentation**, especially in low-resource settings.\n",
        "* However, **more is not always better**: unfiltered synthetic content can dilute signal quality and degrade robustness.\n",
        "* There's a need for **filtering, weighting**, or **feedback-driven generation** (e.g., sampling based on false positives/negatives) to fine-tune the balance between signal and noise.\n"
