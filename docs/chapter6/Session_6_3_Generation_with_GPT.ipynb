I remembered having liked this little sleeper when I first saw it, and I liked it even better on second viewing.<br /><br />All of the actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as the twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother), are superb. The film has a very genuine feel to it--an understated, quiet, deeply moving story of a family aching with grief. The dialogue is sparse but telling, and the nonverbal acting is outstanding. Sort of like a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics.<br /><br />The Stone Boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it.\n",

        "            The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.\n",

        "            Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it\\'s intrigue, I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained \"your father died today\" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.<br /><br />This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.<br /><br />This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it\\'s over. I LOVED movies such as \"Trainspotting\" or \"Requiem for a Dream\" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn.\n",

        "            I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /><br />I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this...\n",

            "This film is a glaring example of squandered potential and missed opportunities. The concept of two rival dancers finding love amidst a blackout is promising, but the execution falls flat. The plot meanders aimlessly, relying heavily on tired tropes and superficial encounters that fail to evoke any genuine chemistry between the leads, portrayed by Amelia Wong and Luca Martinez, whose performances range from wooden to painfully clichéd.

Special effects, presumably used to dramatize the blackout, are jarring and poorly executed, detracting further from the narrative rather than enhancing it.\n",

            "\"Sundown in the Suburbs\" attempts to deliver a quirky dark comedy yet stumbles clumsily through its own muddled narrative, leaving viewers perplexed rather than amused. The film’s premise—a middle-class family experiencing chaos during a summer block party—has potential, but the execution is painfully lackluster. The dialogue falls flat, often relying on tired clichés and awkward attempts at humor that rarely land.\n",

            "Acting performances by the ensemble cast are uneven; while a few actors shine, many struggle to bring their one-dimensional characters to life, resulting in a disconnection that makes it hard to care about any of their fates. The direction lacks a coherent vision, and scenes drag aimlessly, making the supposed humor feel forced and tedious.\n",
            "\n",
            "The score is equally forgettable, failing to elevate the film’s sporadic attempts at tension or comedy. Special effects, meant to enhance the bizarre occurrences, instead come off as cheap and distracting. In a world filled with clever dark comedies, this film feels more like a missed opportunity, leaving the viewer wishing for a script overhaul and a sharper comedic touch. Ultimately, it's a forgettable romp that neither entertains nor resonates.\n",

        "\n",
        "We gradually added synthetic data in increments of 50 examples (balanced: 50 positive + 50 negative), up to 500.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Boost (Up to \\~650 samples total):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Adding up to 400 synthetic samples (for a total of 650) significantly improved all metrics.\n",
        "   * At this point, the model reached an **F1 score of \\~0.92**, nearly matching our previous benchmark trained with **1,000 real samples**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Degradation Beyond 650 Samples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * As we pushed beyond 650 total samples, performance **plateaued or slightly declined**.\n",
        "   * This suggests that adding too many synthetic examples can **introduce noise**, reduce diversity, or cause the model to overfit on artificial patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Instability with Some Sizes (e.g., 350 samples):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * We observed **sharp performance drops** at certain points, particularly around 350 total samples.\n",
        "   * This shows that **not all synthetic examples are helpful** — some may confuse the model or misalign with the task distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎓 What This Tells Us\n",
        "\n",
        "* Synthetic reviews from LLMs can be **incredibly powerful for data augmentation**, especially in low-resource settings.\n",
        "* However, **more is not always better**: unfiltered synthetic content can dilute signal quality and degrade robustness.\n",
        "* There's a need for **filtering, weighting**, or **feedback-driven generation** (e.g., sampling based on false positives/negatives) to fine-tune the balance between signal and noise.\n"
