## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Each notebook is designed with specific learning objectives:

1. **Python Fundamentals**: Ensure you have the necessary programming skills for NLP
2. **Baseline Approaches**: Learn to implement and evaluate simple NLP solutions
3. **Text Representation**: Understand how to convert text into numerical representations
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Learn how to properly evaluate NLP models

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### 📦 Installation

We use Poetry to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

#### 1️⃣ Install Poetry

**macOS / Linux**:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

**Windows**:
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

#### 2️⃣ Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agombert/AdvancedNLPClasses.git
cd AdvancedNLPClasses
poetry install
```

#### 3️⃣ Install additional dependencies for notebooks

```bash
poetry add pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn spacy jupyter
poetry run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### 4️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory to access all the notebooks.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the installation:

- **macOS**: You might need to install Xcode command-line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- **Ubuntu**: Ensure you have build essentials: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
- **Windows**: Make sure you have the Microsoft C++ Build Tools installed
